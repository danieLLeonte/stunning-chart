## Process
1. I did a fetch to the GraphQL API using Apollo to see how the data for the posts looks.
2. I documented myself about VISX and started to implement the front-end with some mockdata.
3. After seeing that the graph looks good, I fetched the GraphQL API to represent the posts in the graph.
4. I tested.
5. What I would do now, is to think about an improvement for the logic in processing data from the API.

## Choices
- I chose to keep the design simple and clean, and to focus more to represent the data correctly in the graph.

## Challenges
It was the first time I interacted with GraphQL API and VISX, it was a challenge and I really enjoyed learning.
In the logic part, I encountered a few difficulties until I found the option to correctly represent the data in the graph, but in the end, I got it right.
